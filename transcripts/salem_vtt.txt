The weather tonight is calm with a warm breeze, around 27 degrees.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.000
You're listening to 'Emirati Nights.' I'm your host, Salem —

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000
and tonight, I want to share something special

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.000
This is a short poem by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan —

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.000
the father of our nation. He wasn't just a leader… he was also a poet

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.500
Your love lives deep inside me.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.100
Even a mountain could not carry this feeling.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.200
My heart feels pain because of it.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.200
It stays with me all the time.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
This was from the heart of our leader.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.200
A reminder that love is powerful… and personal.
